The "map" function: returns an iterable where each item is the result of the application
of the first argument (a function) to succesive elements of the second argument (an
iterable)

A function that takes a function as argument or returns a function as the result is a
higher-order function. One example is "map", "sorted". 

"sorted(list, key = ...)": sort the list in the function indicated in the "key" argument. 
Any one-argument function can be used as the key.

In the functional programming paradigm, some of the best known higher-order func‐
tions are map, filter, reduce, and apply.

In Python 3, map and filter return generators—a form of iterator—so their direct
substitute is now a generator expression. 

To determine whether an object is callable, use the callable() built-in function.
