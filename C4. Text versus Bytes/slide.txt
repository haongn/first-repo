A mapping type is a data type comprised of a collection of keys and associated values. 
Pythonâ€™s only built-in mapping type is the dictionary. 
Dictionaries implement the associative array abstract data type.


In computer science, an associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data 
type that stores a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most 
once in the collection. In mathematical terms an associative array is a function with 
finite domain.
It supports 'lookup', 'remove', and 'insert' operations.
